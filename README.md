The Online Movie Booking System is a web application developed as a demonstration project to showcase the functionality of an online movie booking platform. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. The system allows users to register and log in to their accounts. Once logged in, users can browse through a selection of available movies, view showtimes, and book tickets for their preferred shows. The system also provides the option to order snacks for the movie screening. Payments are simulated in the demonstration, allowing users to go through the payment process to complete their bookings. Additionally, the system includes administrative features that enable administrators to manage movie listings, snack items, and view the total collections generated from movie bookings. Please note that this project does not involve real transactions or actual payment processing, but serves as a demonstration of the functionality one would expect from an online movie booking system.
